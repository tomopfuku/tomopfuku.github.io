I am a computational evolutionary biologist with roots in paleobiology, molecular evolution, and phylogenetics. I develop new computational approaches to understand the evolutionary processes and patterns underlying the emergence of novel and complex phenotypic traits. I seek to uncover the limits of our ability to infer the evolutionary processes that drove large-scale evolutionary patterns over deep time by combining information from genomes, phenotypes, and the fossil record. I'm particularly interested in Primates (fossil and living), but I also explore questions in other lineages.

### Joining the lab:

The lab is actively recruiting prospective Ph.D. and M.Sc. students, so get in touch if you are interested in applying to the program this winter. 

Also get in touch if you are interested in doing a postdoc-- numerous funding possibilities exist.

There is also always space for undergrads.

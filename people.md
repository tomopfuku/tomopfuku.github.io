I am a computational evolutionary biologist rooted in paleobiology and phylogenetics. I develop new computational approaches to understand the evolutionary processes and patterns underlying the emergence of novel and complex phenotypic traits. I seek to uncover the limits of our ability to infer the microevolutionary processes that drove large-scale evolutionary patterns over deep time by combining information from genomes, phenotypes, and the fossil record. I explore these questions across a range of fossil, and sometimes living, systems.
